**Results**
* Shows Percentage of People Who Died of Covid in Nigeria.
* Calculated the percentage of people who died of COVID-19 in Nigeria, giving insights into the mortality rate in that country.
* Shows the Percentage of the Population Diagnosed with COVID-19 in Nigeria.
* Determined the percentage of the population in Nigeria that was diagnosed with Covid-19.
* Shows Countries with the Highest Infection Rate Compared to Population
* Found countries with the highest infection rate relative to their population, identifying the most affected countries.
* Found Countries with the Highest Death Count per Population
* Identified the countries with the highest death count relative to their population.
* Found the Continent with the Highest Death Count
* Determined which continent had the highest total death count from Covid-19.
* Shows the Total Population of Vaccinated People
* Calculated the number of people vaccinated by country and continent over time.
* Percentage of Total Vaccinated People per Day using CTE
* Common Table Expressions (CTEs) were used to calculate the rolling percentage of the population vaccinated per day.
*Used temporary tables to achieve similar results as the CTE, providing another method to calculate the rolling vaccination percentage.
